# int-traffic
Analyzing internet traffic.

# Main Questions
- How does my internet speed vary over time?
- Is there a lot of variance? little?
- Does time of day affect it?
- Does where the traffic is going matter?

# Ping

- Seeing most traffic < 100 ms, then another bump at around 6/700
  - Potential rerouting? (traceroute)

# TODO

- [ ] Merge in route traffic
